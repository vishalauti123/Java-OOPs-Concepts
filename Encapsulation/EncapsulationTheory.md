# Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping variables (data) and methods 
that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

- Data hiding is achieved using **private variables**.
- Access is provided using **getter** and **setter** methods.
- Helps in security and code maintenance.

### Real-life Example
Like a capsule in medicine â†’ medicine is wrapped inside a protective cover.  
In Java, variables are wrapped inside the class and cannot be accessed directly.
